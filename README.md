## About me
I'm a Ph.D. student at Rutgers University studying physical oceanography. I am originally from North Carolina where I did my undergrad in physics at UNC-Wilmington. I am interested in coastal and estuarine research and my thesis is on drivers of residual circulation in multi-inlet lagoon systems. I use both models and observational data in my research. 

## Research Interests 
Multi-inet lagoons, or shallow estuaries with multiple inlets, are common throughout the world. Due to frictional effects we often assume tides are strongly attenuated and as a result that the systems are predominantley wind driven. But some systems appear to have persistent flows that are tidally driven. I am interested in why some systems are tidally driven while others are wind driven. I'm also interested in what controls these tidally driven residual flows.

More broadly I am interested in any physics to do with coastal or estuarine processes.  

## Hobbies
I am an avid runner and a member of the local run club in my community. I have ambitions of running the six world major marathons (1/6). When I have the time I enjoy getting down to the shore to surf or going to the catskills to camp.
